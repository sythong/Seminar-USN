## Prerequisites:

### Anaconda
- Download anaconda 5.3 with Python 3.7 from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)  
- Follow the installation steps  
- Open Anaconda Prompt (Start -> Anaconda Prompt)  
- Create a new environment:  `conda create --name <environment name> python=3`  
- List all the environments to see if the created environment was created: `conda env list`  
- Activate the environment:  `activate <environment name>`  

The default `python=3` environment should install python most recent version (by the date this tutorial was create, it was **3.7.0**).

### Jupyter Notebook

The examples presented in the class will be written in jupyter notebook. By installing anaconda environment in these instructions, jupyter notebook will also be installed.  

I recommend the installation of the **nb_conda** in your environment. This is a package that gives you access to conda extensions in the jupyter notebook. For that, activate your environment, and run the command `conda install nb_conda`  

In order to run jupyter notebook, activate your environment and run the command: `jupyter notebook`
